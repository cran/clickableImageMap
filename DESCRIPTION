Description: Implement 'tableGrob' object as a clickable image map.
    The 'clickableImageMap' package is designed to be more convenient and more configurable than the edit() function.
    Limitations that I have encountered with edit() are cannot control
    (1) positioning
    (2) size
    (3) appearance and formatting of fonts
    In contrast, when the table is implemented as a 'tableGrob', all of these features are controllable.
    In particular, the 'ggplot2' grid system allows exact positioning of the table relative to
    other graphics etc.
